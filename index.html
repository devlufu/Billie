          <div class="post-content">

              Artificial intelligence applications have been used in a wide range of fields including medical diagnosis, stock trading, robot control, law, scientific discovery and toys.
              However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI, A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.
              Many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry.
